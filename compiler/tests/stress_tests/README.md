# Run and display summary

## Run

You can:
- ```make stress-tests```, tests replications are parallelized but tests are not parallelized
- ```make stress-tests-fast```, tests and KeySetCache generation are parallelized, useful for a first run

## Summary

```make show-stress-tests```

# Raw results

In directory ```streestests/trace```:
- ```test_controlled```, contains experiments with controlled code and parameters cases that should run fine
- ```test_wild```, contains experiments with less controlled code and parameters that explores the limits of the compiler.

All experiment are currently a weighted sum with a constant weight followed by an identity function.

These two directories contains one experiment file per experiment, named ```XXXbits_x_YYY_W``` where XXX is the precision, YYY is the size of the computation and W is the experiment non structural parameter (here the weight in the sum).

Files are in json format but can easily be grepped (multi-lines).
