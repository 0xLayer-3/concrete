# Format

Sometimes, it can be useful to print circuits. We provide methods to just do that.

## Formatting

You can convert your compiled circuit into its textual representation by converting it to string:

<!--pytest-codeblocks:skip-->
```python
str(circuit)
```

If you just want to see the output on your terminal, you can directly print it as well:

<!--pytest-codeblocks:skip-->
```python
print(circuit)
```
