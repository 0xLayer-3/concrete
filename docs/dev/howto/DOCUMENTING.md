# Documenting

## Making docs with Sphinx

One can simply create docs with Sphinx and open them, by doing:

```shell
make docs
```

The documentation contains both files written by hand by developpers and files automatically created by parsing the source files.

### Opening doc

On macOS, one can do

```shell
make open_docs
```

On other systems, simply open `docs/_build/html/index.html`
