## Code

% Coding style, Tests, comments style

The LLVM formatting is used for the C++ code.

[LLVM FileCheck](https://www.llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.html) is used for tests on dialects (lowering, roundtripping).
[GoogleTest](https://google.github.io/googletest/) is used for other tests.

Documentation comments use three slashes, ///, instead of two. 
Place documentation comments just before the item theyâ€™re documenting.
