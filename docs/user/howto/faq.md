## What is **Concrete Numpy**?

See [here](../basics/intro.md). Also, you can have a look to Zama's [website](https://zama.ai) or to the [Concrete library GitHub](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete).

## Is it an open source project?

Our mission at Zama is to protect peopleâ€™s privacy by preventing data breaches and unethical surveillance.

Following a recent breakthrough in fully homomorphic encryption, we are building a deep learning framework that enables fast and accurate inference over encrypted data, with minimal performance overhead, no changes to the network architecture, and no retraining necessary. Zama is open-source by design, as we believe privacy-enabling technologies should benefit the widest possible community of developers and researchers. If you are interested in the details, be sure to read our licensing agreement in the root of the repository.
